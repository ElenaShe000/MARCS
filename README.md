# Introduction 

What changes are observed in the Arctic?

Observations evident environmental changes connected to enhanced warming of the Arctic (also known as the Arctic Amplification): shrinkage of an ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, degradation of a permafrost in Siberia, melting of glaciers in Svalbard and Central Asia, shifting in synoptic atmospheric circulation in Europe. In turn, the synoptic atmospheric processes determine regional distribution of the precipitation, the evaporation, the river runoff and water resource of lakes. These changes in the atmospheric circulation leads to weather and hydrological extreme events latest often observed in many European countries (XXX; XXX). These extreme events also known as heat waves and droughts, heavy rainfall and floods,  avalanches, etc. They damage social infrastructure, kill people and result to economical losses. Therefore, the early prediction of these extremes is among the actual task for national hydrometorological service. This study contributed to improving the methods of the seasonal prediction of floods. 

How the AA is detected?


As the unhomogenity in the observed series of meteorological and hydrological series dates to late 1990s, and the legths of the observated  series seems to be too short to distigush the reason of the unhomogenity: would it attribute to natural variability or forced by human activity (Koenigk et al., 2020; XX). 



What are the risks of hydropower hydropower production? 
Humans traditionally use water of lakes and rivers in energy production. The hydropower generation is among others social activities highly related to weather phenomena and hydrological regime of the rivers and lakes. The risks of in the hydropower generation is  closely related the hydrological events of rare occurrence (or extremes). These hydrological extremes (including floods and drought) are traditionally estimated from time series of the lake level and/or river water discharge observed at a network of gauges. The observations on the gauges include the water level/stage daily river discharge are usually evaluated the level time series are hydrological observations are mostly launched in begging of the last century, and almost until end of 1990s, no significant trend are observed in the hydrological time series. It allows to apply statistical methods of the frequency analyse (XX) while estimating the hydrological events of rare occurrence, i.e. the floods happened once per 10, 100, or 1000 years. The exceedance probability curves of yearly maximum river runoff provides whole information to assessment of the risks connected to extreme floods in a particular hydropower construction (XX;XX; Shevnina, 2014; Kovalenko, 2004).

trends in hydrological time series: Finland 13 non regulated basins, Korhonen and Kuusisto, 2010; Russian Arctic, Shevnina, 2013; 
Korhonen, 2019: "the  analyses  show  statistically  significant  changes  in  both  ice  cover  and  discharge  regime until the early 21st century". 
Nowadays, the stationary assumption is doubted due to trends detected in time series observed meteorological variables (Vihma et al., 2016) as well as in river water discharges [Rosmann et al., 2016; Milly et al., 2005; 2008].
Shevnina et al., 2019; Shevnina, 2011

Why hydropower production is important?
Most of hydropower plants have no artificial reservoirs to redistribute water year-by-year, and they operate as run-of-river facility forced by naturally flowing river water  through canals or penstocks to spin a turbine [47]. The hydropower production on run-of-river plants depends strongly on a river water discharge, since there are no tools to regulate water stream flow.

How the risks of hydropower are estimated?


Since late 1990s, the statistically significant trends are detected in many time series of yearly average, maximal and minimal river discharges (XXX; XXX; XXX). ... These trends are connected either human activities (water regulation; change of a land cover) and/or natural fluctuations in weather and climate patterns, however they limit the application of the frequency analyses due to a stationarity hypothesis (XX;XX). In the stationary climate, the hydrological risks are evaluated from the observations. In changing climate, the risks are usually evaluated with hydrological models relayed on projections of meteorological parameters for the near future. 

How the exeedance probability curve is estimated?


What are limitations and gaps in the hydrological methods?

The lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models traditionally used for short term or seasonal scale simulating surface runoff times series from time series of meteorological variables [50]. In many catchment scale hydrological studies these models are driven by outputs of climate climate models or their ensemble to evaluate water resources and extremes of runoff in the near future on catchment scale [28, 49, 64]. However, the simulation of the surface runoff time series from the time series of meteorological variables (as in Veijalainen et al. 201XX) leads to high computational costs while estimating the hydrological extremes needed in economic application [65]. 

 the AFA method (Kovalenko, 2009; Kovalenko, 2004; Pugachev, 1978). 
It is implemented in the probabilistic hydrological model, whch is computationally cheap while to compare to lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models (Shevnina and Silaev, 2018). Shevnina et al., (2017)
Role of spatial resolution: We used two climate models of different spatial resolutions to test the probabilistic MARCS model simulated the parameters of exceedance probability curves on a catchment scale. We found that an increase of the spatial resolution does not affect to the results of simulations. 
 
What and why needed to focus on the probabilistic approach?

# hydrological observations

???We selected the hydrological sites oultined the catchment area less then 1000 km2 were excluded to skip off local scale features in the hydrological regime. Some studies reccomend also exclude the gauges outlined the catchments with the area more 50000 km2 to being not accounted for the global scale features in the hydrological regime of the rivers considered (Rozhdestvenskiy, 1986). In our study, we also included those gauges since the area of 50 000 km2 (or 200 km x 250 km) which is much smaller than a typical radius of a synoptic-scale cyclone (XXX; XX). ???


We used the series of statistics for the river discharges given in the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive (GSIM), which  is included set of statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation, quantiles, etc) calculated from series of river discharges observed at hydrological sites located the Word wide (Gudmunsson et al., 2018). The archive is based on the daily series of river discharches collected over 12 hydrological datasets, and the authors used uniformed methods while evaluating the quality control of hydrological records and streamflow indexes. Further, the series of the indexes were selected at site located in the rivers with (a) the catchement area more than 1000 km2; (b) not disturbed by water regulation; (c) the longest observational time series of a good quality; (d) location in various climate (vegetation) zones. We used the indexes estimated from the records collected for 29 sites listed further:

Figure XX shows the location 29 hydrological gauges considered in the further analyses. The metadata of the indexes includes the river name, station name, altitude, catchment area, date of start/end of series, the length, information on data quality control and national identification. The selected hydrological sites are located at the rivers with (a) catchment area more than 1000 km2; (b)  not disturbed by water regulation; (c) longest observational time series of a high quality; (d) located in various climate (vegetation) zones. The hydrological sites are mostly located in two climate zones (C and D according to Beck et al., 2018). The list of the stations includes 8 gauges located in Russia, 4 gauges in Norway, 2 gauges in Finland, 2 gauges in Germany, Great Britain, and 1 gauges in in Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, the Netherlands, Iceland, Belarus, Czech, Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania. There no any time series longer then 39 years were found in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greek.

There are 24 streamflow indexes aggregated over a month, season and year given by Gudmunsson et al. (2018). The statistic include the mean, minimal and maximal values, the standard deviation, the statistical percentiles (1, 5, 10, ...) and more depending on the period of aggregation. The yearly indexes also include dates for mean, maximal and minimal discharges. Further, we analyses the series of yearly mean, maximal and minimal river discharges in order to evaluate long-term variability  in annual, maximal and minimal types of river runoff (WMO_hydrology, XXX). These types of river runoff allow to understand recent changes in hydrological regime and surface water resources, and its affect to frequency and severity of extreme droughts and floods. Most of the time series limited by 2014 or even early, and it would be possible to have the series covering later years from the local dataset (i.e. for Finnish rivers, the river discharges are available until 2020).  

Gudmundsson et al. (2018) analyse the homogenity of the long-term series of the streamflow indexes with the standard normal homogeneity test (Alexandersson, 1986), Buishand's range test (Buishand, 1982),  Pettitt's test (Pettitt, 1979) and von Neumann ratio test (Jaiswal et al. 2015). 


       
Table XX shows the gauges, catchment areas and lengths of the time series, which was used in analyse of the river surface runoff. In GRDC datasets, the observations on the river surface runoff is expressed in a volumetric flow rate (water discharge, m3s-1). In our study, the volumetric rate was converted to a specific water discharge, and the yearly time series of annual specific discharge (noted further as ARR, mm yr-1 ) were calculated as follows:
ARR = 1000 Q T / A,				 (1)
where Q is a yearly average water discharge, m3s-1; T is a number of seconds in a year, and A is a catchment area, m2. This formula was applied while calculating the water discharge from the annual specific discharge for the projected period.

# the large scale synoptic circulation classification


# the probabilistic hydrological model  

We calibrated the hydrological model with the meteorological data extracted from the ERA5 or ERA-Interim reanalyses. We estimated the yearly and monthly mean and standard deviation for the following meteorological variables: the atmospheric presure (at level...?), 2m air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, net precipitation, evaporation. The meteorological parameters were extracted at the model node nearest to the centroid of the watershed.
