# Introduction 

What is floods?


Why floods?
Observations evidence environmental changes connected to enhanced warming over the Arctic (also known as the Arctic Amplification): shrinkage of an ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, degradation of a permafrost in Siberia, melting of glaciers in Svalbard and Central Asia, shifting in synoptic atmospheric circulation in Europe (XXX;XXX). In turn, the synoptic atmospheric processes determine regional distribution of precipitation, evaporation, river runoff and water resource of lakes and aquifers. The changed atmospheric circulation leads to weather and hydrological extreme events latest often observed in many European countries (XXX; XXX). Among others, increase of water level in rivers, lakes and artifical reservoirs may lead to overflooded of large territories. Extreme floods damage social infrastructure (roads, bridges, pipes and hydraulic constraction of hydropower plants), kill people and result to economical losses.  Therefore, the early prediction of these extremes is among the actual task for national hydrometorological service. This study contributed to improving methods of seasonal prediction of floods. 

What are sources of floods?
River floods are usually sourced from spring melting of snow cover accumulated over winter or from heavy rainfalls over summer and autumn seasons. The spring floods are typical in the northern regions of Europe, whereas the rain-induced floods mostly happen on the south of the continent. In t

Atmosferic water content == Evaporation
Naakka et al., 2019: 
"Dufouret al. (2016)found that although the atmospheric moisture content has already increased in the Arctic,..." 
"Atmospheric moisture content has a strong seasonal cyclein high latitudes (Naakka et al., 2018), and the amount oftotal moisture transport was closely related to this cycle,because the total moisture transport is simply a product ofthe atmospheric moisture content and scalar meridionalwind speed. "
"As an annual mean, the total moisture transport wasseveral times larger than the net moisture transport. Accord-ingly, most of the northwards moisture transport was bal-anced by southwards moisture transport."


As the unhomogenity in the observed series of meteorological and hydrological series dates to late 1990s, and the legths of the observated  series seems to be too short to distigush the reason of the unhomogenity: would it attribute to natural variability or forced by human activity (Koenigk et al., 2020; XX). 



What are the risks of hydropower hydropower production? 
Humans traditionally use water of lakes and rivers in energy production. The hydropower generation is among others social activities highly related to weather phenomena and hydrological regime of the rivers and lakes. The risks of in the hydropower generation is related the hydrological events of rare occurrence (or extremes). These hydrological extremes (including floods and drought) are traditionally estimated from time series of the lake level and/or river water discharge observed at a network of gauges. The observations on the gauges include the water level/stage daily river discharge are usually evaluated the level time series are hydrological observations are mostly launched in begging of the last century, and almost until end of 1990s, no significant trend are observed in the hydrological time series. It allows to apply statistical methods of the frequency analyse (XX) while estimating the hydrological events of rare occurrence, i.e. the floods happened once per 10, 100, or 1000 years. The exceedance probability curves of yearly maximum river runoff provides whole information to assessment of the risks connected to extreme floods in a particular hydropower construction (XX;XX; Shevnina, 2014; Kovalenko, 2004).

trends in hydrological time series: Finland 13 non regulated basins, Korhonen and Kuusisto, 2010; Russian Arctic, Shevnina, 2013; 
Korhonen, 2019: "the  analyses  show  statistically  significant  changes  in  both  ice  cover  and  discharge  regime until the early 21st century". 
Nowadays, the stationary assumption is doubted due to trends detected in time series observed meteorological variables (Vihma et al., 2016) as well as in river water discharges [Rosmann et al., 2016; Milly et al., 2005; 2008].
Shevnina et al., 2019; Shevnina, 2011

Why hydropower production is important?
Most of hydropower plants have no artificial reservoirs to redistribute water year-by-year, and they operate as run-of-river facility forced by naturally flowing river water  through canals or penstocks to spin a turbine [47]. The hydropower production on run-of-river plants depends strongly on a river water discharge, since there are no tools to regulate water stream flow.

How the risks of hydropower are estimated?


Since late 1990s, the statistically significant trends are detected in many time series of yearly average, maximal and minimal river discharges (XXX; XXX; XXX). ... These trends are connected either human activities (water regulation; change of a land cover) and/or natural fluctuations in weather and climate patterns, however they limit the application of the frequency analyses due to a stationarity hypothesis (XX;XX). In the stationary climate, the hydrological risks are evaluated from the observations. In changing climate, the risks are usually evaluated with hydrological models relayed on projections of meteorological parameters for the near future. 

How the exeedance probability curve is estimated?


What are limitations and gaps in the hydrological methods?

The lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models traditionally used for short term or seasonal scale simulating surface runoff times series from time series of meteorological variables [50]. In many catchment scale hydrological studies these models are driven by outputs of climate climate models or their ensemble to evaluate water resources and extremes of runoff in the near future on catchment scale [28, 49, 64]. However, the simulation of the surface runoff time series from the time series of meteorological variables (as in Veijalainen et al. 201XX) leads to high computational costs while estimating the hydrological extremes needed in economic application [65]. 

 the AFA method (Kovalenko, 2009; Kovalenko, 2004; Pugachev, 1978). 
It is implemented in the probabilistic hydrological model, whch is computationally cheap while to compare to lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models (Shevnina and Silaev, 2018). Shevnina et al., (2017)
Role of spatial resolution: We used two climate models of different spatial resolutions to test the probabilistic MARCS model simulated the parameters of exceedance probability curves on a catchment scale. We found that an increase of the spatial resolution does not affect to the results of simulations. 
 
What and why needed to focus on the probabilistic approach?


The study aims 
 
 ... toward long term prediction of extreme floods and droughts (service: hydropower, roads insfrustructure, agriculture, 
 
 ... toward seasonal prediction of river runoff on a catchment scale (service for hydropower production).

# hydrological observations

???We selected the hydrological sites oultined the catchment area less then 1000 km2 were excluded to skip off local scale features in the hydrological regime. Some studies reccomend also exclude the gauges outlined the catchments with the area more 50000 km2 to being not accounted for the global scale features in the hydrological regime of the rivers considered (Rozhdestvenskiy, 1986). In our study, we also included those gauges since the area of 50 000 km2 (or 200 km x 250 km) which is much smaller than a typical radius of a synoptic-scale cyclone (XXX; XX). ???


We used the series of statistics for the river discharges given in the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive (GSIM), which  is included set of statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation, quantiles, etc) calculated from series of river discharges observed at hydrological sites located the Word wide (Gudmunsson et al., 2018). The archive is based on the daily series of river discharches collected over 12 hydrological datasets, and the authors used uniformed methods while evaluating the quality control of hydrological records and streamflow indexes. Further, the series of the indexes were selected at sites located in the rivers with (a)  catchement area more than 1000 km2; (b) not disturbed by water regulation; (c) the observational time series of a good quality; (d) location in various climate (vegetation) zones. 

Gudmunsson et al. (2018) give the information on the caracteristic of the river basins outlined by the hydrological gauges. Among others, the characteristic include the number of dams, the data quaility class, the climate type, the soil type and the length of the series of the indices. 


Figure XX shows the location hydrological gauges considered in the further analyses. The metadata of the indexes includes the river name, station name, altitude, catchment area, date of start/end of series, the length, information on data quality control and national identification. The selected hydrological sites are located at the rivers with (a) catchment area more than 1000 km2; (b)  not disturbed by water regulation; (c) longest observational time series of a high quality; (d) located in various climate (vegetation) zones. The hydrological sites are mostly located in two climate zones (C and D according to Beck et al., 2018). The list of the stations includes 8 gauges located in Russia, 4 gauges in Norway, 2 gauges in Finland, 2 gauges in Germany, Great Britain, and 1 gauges in in Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, the Netherlands, Iceland, Belarus, Czech, Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania. There no any time series longer then 39 years were found in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greek.

table 2 -  gauges ID associated with the reference data sets (GRDC= Global runoff dataset; EWA?; arcticXX - RArctic, Shiklomanov);
table 3 -  gauges with lat/lon,altitude and area


There are 24 streamflow indexes aggregated over a month, season and year given by Gudmunsson et al. (2018). The statistic include the mean, minimal and maximal values, the standard deviation, the statistical percentiles (1, 5, 10, ...) and more depending on the period of aggregation. The yearly indexes also include dates for mean, maximal and minimal discharges. Further, we analyses the long term series of yearly minimal river discharges and the dates of the maximal river discharges. Further analyses of the series of maximal river discharches allow to  understand better recent changes in frequency and severity of extreme floods. Most of the time series limited by 2014 or even early, and it would be possible to have the series covering later years from the local dataset (i.e. for Finnish rivers, the river discharges are available until 2020).  



       
Table 1 shows the gauges, catchment areas and lengths of the time series, which was used in analyse of the river surface runoff. In GRDC datasets, the observations on the river surface runoff is expressed in a volumetric flow rate (water discharge, m3s-1). In our study, the volumetric rate was converted to a specific water discharge, and the yearly time series of annual specific discharge (noted further as ARR, mm yr-1 ) were calculated as follows:
ARR = 1000 Q T / A,				 (1)
where Q is a yearly average water discharge, m3s-1; T is a number of seconds in a year, and A is a catchment area, m2. This formula was applied while calculating the water discharge from the annual specific discharge for the projected period.

## 2 Methods

I. Homogenity tests (Elena)

1a. Gudmundsson et al. (2018) analyse the homogenity of the long-term series of the streamflow indexes with the standard normal homogeneity test (Alexandersson, 1986), Buishand's range test (Buishand, 1982),  Pettitt's test (Pettitt, 1979) and von Neumann ratio test (Jaiswal et al. 2015). There are no trend found in the time series of annual mean river dicharges. However, the statistically significant inhogeneity are detected the series of annual maximum river dicharge for 5 rivers (Vosso River, Ura River, Lea River, Thames River and Gave d'Oloron River) as well as in the series of the date of annual maxumum for 3 rivers (Fulda River, Glama River and Solza River).

 ... initail first 3(4) moments for the homogeneous time series

II. "Quasi-stasionary periods" (Elena)

2. Shevnina et al., 2019: the whole period of observations was divided into the sub-periods with the statistically significant difference (shift) inthe mean values. Dividing into the subsamples was done ac-cording to the Student’sttest using the moving window ap-proach (Ducré-Robitaille et al., 2003). We begin from set-ting the size of the first subsample to the chosen minimum(15 members).
  ... years of shift

III. "Stability of statistical moments" (Elena)

3. Kovalenko, 2006: beta criteria given in Kovalenko et al., 2011

IV. Relationship between precipitation, evaporation and runoff (Tuomas Naakka, Timo Vihma)

4. Two coefficents of runoff (mean and max), an effective precipitation for floods (sourced by snow or rain)

5. Two correlations coefficients (PRE_year vs ARR, PRE_year vs FDR, PRE_season vs FDR) 

V. Relationship between synoptic types and dates of yearly maximum runoff

6: Toward a seasonal prediction of dates of floods: linear/non linear correlation with the SOM indexes (with Nygard et al., 2019). 


Q7:How is the accuracy of the atmospheric pressure in the ERA-Interim affect to to detection of the atmospheric large scale circulation for in the regions with various orography?

Q8: Why the number of patterns on the SOM analyses was set 30?

Q9: What do you think, are there any principle differences in the circulation regimes (patterns) given after the SOM analyses from those groups suggested by Hess-Brezowsky (30 patterns) or the classes given according to Vangengeim and Girs (26 patterns) mentioned here: http://www.borenv.net/BER/archive/pdfs/ber7/ber7-273.pdf ?

Q10: Have you the archive with the classification patterns after the SOM for the period of 1979-2019?

Q11: How time demanding may be the task to calculate the 30y means and standard deviations for the net precipitation under 4 typical synoptic patterns (5, 15, 26 and 30) at one site with given location?

Tuomas, unfortunally it was not possibl to access your paper about the atmospheric moister transport:

beacuse it is not under the open-access. Therefore, would it possible to share with me this paper?'



# Discussions

1. Trends in the time series of yearly series 

a). Gudmunson et al. 2018: yearly mean and maximum river discharges 

b). 25 river basins located in Finland (Korhonen and Kuusamo, 2010); 13 unregulated basins + 12 regulated; longest series until 2004; yearly mean discharge, monthly and seasonal river discharges, annual maximum and minimum flows; no trends in yearly mean discharges, yes trends in seasonla series, in most sites (64%) the winter and/or spring discharges have increased. 

c). 50 river basins located in the Russian Arctic Shevnina  (2011); longest series of spring flood depth until 1980; 18% % time series are non-homogenius in terms of mean dispersion (student and Fisher criteria), and it is in accordance with Rozhdestvemskiy (red), 1988. also, 33 river basins, the longest series until 2008, 43% of non-homogenity detected by Student, Fisher and Kolmogorov tests on 1,5, and 10 of significance levels. 68% of the river basins are located in European part of the Russian Arctic (shevnina, 2015).

d). Shiklomanov et al., 2007:

e). Blöschl et al. 2019: "show that clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the last five decades in Europe are evident, which are likely manifestations of a changing climate. Our results suggest that (i) increasing autumn and winter rainfall has led to increasing floods in northwestern Europe, (ii) decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe and (iii) decreasing snowcover and snowmelt as a result of warmer temperatures have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of +11.4%
per decade to a decrease of -23.1%. "... 

f). Durocher et al., 2019: 72 rivers with runoff into Arctic Ocean, trends for the period 1975 to 2015 + correlation with the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation (PDO).


e) Blöschl et al. 2017: "We analyzed the timing of river floods in Europeover the past five decades, using a pan-European database from 4262 observationalhydrometric stations, and found clear patterns of change in flood timing. Warmertemperatures have led to earlier spring snowmelt floods throughout northeasternEurope; delayed winter storms associated with polar warming have led to later winterfloods around the North Sea and some sectors of the Mediterranean coast; andearlier soil moisture maxima have led to earlier winter floods in western Europe. Ourresults highlight the existence of a clear climate signal in flood observations at thecontinental scale"

g) Hall et al. 2014: "There is growing concern that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network."


# the large scale synoptic circulation classification


# the probabilistic hydrological model  

We calibrated the hydrological model with the meteorological data extracted from the ERA5 or ERA-Interim reanalyses. We estimated the yearly and monthly mean and standard deviation for the following meteorological variables: the atmospheric presure (at level...?), 2m air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, net precipitation, evaporation. The meteorological parameters were extracted at the model node nearest to the centroid of the watershed.
