# Introduction 

What changes are observed in the Arctic?

Observations evident environmental changes connected to enhanced warming of the Arctic (also known as the Arctic Amplification): shrinkage of an ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, degradation of a permafrost in Siberia, melting of glaciers in Svalbard and Central Asia, shifting in synoptic atmospheric circulation in Europe. In turn, the synoptic atmospheric processes determine regional distribution of the precipitation, the evaporation, the river runoff and water resource of lakes. These changes in the atmospheric circulation leads to weather and hydrological extreme events latest often observed in many European countries (XXX; XXX). These extreme events also known as heat waves and droughts, heavy rainfall and floods,  avalanches, etc. They damage social infrastructure, kill people and result to economical losses. Therefore, the early prediction of these extremes is among the actual task for national hydrometorological service. This study contributed to improving the methods of the seasonal prediction of floods. 

How the AA is detected?


As the unhomogenity in the observed series of meteorological and hydrological series dates to late 1990s, and the legths of the observated  series seems to be too short to distigush the reason of the unhomogenity: would it attribute to natural variability or forced by human activity (Koenigk et al., 2020; XX). 

How the data from SYNOP sites are used in the analyses of the synoptic scale processes?

What is the climate reanalyses?

Source of the modelled meteorological variables: 2m air temperature, wind speed, net precipitation, 
and modelled evaporation calculated with the energy budget method (?)

How AA affects to climate and weather in Europe?


How weather and climate is predicted in Europe?


What will be impacts of the expected climate change in various economical sectors: agriculture and food production, forestry, fi sheries, reindeer husbandry, game management, water resources, biodiversity, industry, energy, traffi c, land use and communities, building, health, tourism and recreation, and insurance. 

climate classification?

"During the last several decades, the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), operated under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), has allowed National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) to share a wide variety of meteorological data regionally and worldwide. However, there has been no formal mechanism or requirement to share daily data via the GTS and no central repository for daily climate reports from national surface networks. In practice, the transmission of daily climate summaries has been treated as optional even for the network of stations that report temperature, precipitation, surface pressure, etc., at fixed synoptic hours [i.e., every 3 or 6 h for stations in the Regional Basic Synoptic Network (RBSN)]. Similarly, stations in the WMO’s Regional Basic Climate Network (largely a subset of the RBSN) are only required to provide a monthly climate summary known as CLIMAT and likewise do not consistently transmit daily summaries within their synoptic messages (WMO 2003)."

"The Global Summary of the Day contains 24-hour summaries encoded in the special “climatological code” group transmitted with SYNOP reports on the GTS. "


The source data are obtained via "contacts with representatives from National Meteorological and Hydrological Centers (NMHCs) around the world, through official bi-lateral agreements, and from a number a data archives" including the Intenational Collection.
"The International Collection contains historical records for approximately 20,000 locations outside the United States (from over 100 different countries) and largely reflects the data collection efforts that led to the release of Global Daily Climatology Network dataset" 

The quality the date is estimated with procedures suggested by Klein et al., 2002: Klein Tank, A.M.G. and Coauthors, 2002. Daily dataset of 20th-century surface air temperature and precipitation series for the European Climate Assessment. Int. J. of Climatol., 22, 1441-1453. 

2. the Global Summary Of the Day (GSOD) database (https://data.noaa.gov). 

How the seasonal patterns of precipitation / evaporation / river runoff are changed since late 1990s?

The increase of the near surface temperature leads to changes in  general water balance for many regions. The general water balance is a budget equation relates the precipitation, runoff (surface and underground) and evaporation. 

AA enhances the atmospheric transport of moist air between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, and it contributes to changes in the hydrological cycle, precipitation and clouds (XX; XX). 

What are the risks of hydropower hydropower production? 
Humans traditionally use water of lakes and rivers in energy production. The hydropower generation is among others social activities highly related to weather phenomena and hydrological regime of the rivers and lakes. The risks of in the hydropower generation is  closely related the hydrological events of rare occurrence (or extremes). These hydrological extremes (including floods and drought) are traditionally estimated from time series of the lake level and/or river water discharge observed at a network of gauges. The observations on the gauges include the water level/stage daily river discharge are usually evaluated the level time series are hydrological observations are mostly launched in begging of the last century, and almost until end of 1990s, no significant trend are observed in the hydrological time series. It allows to apply statistical methods of the frequency analyse (XX) while estimating the hydrological events of rare occurrence, i.e. the floods happened once per 10, 100, or 1000 years. The exceedance probability curves of yearly maximum river runoff provides whole information to assessment of the risks connected to extreme floods in a particular hydropower construction (XX;XX; Shevnina, 2014; Kovalenko, 2004).

trends in hydrological time series: Finland 13 non regulated basins, Korhonen and Kuusisto, 2010; Russian Arctic, Shevnina, 2013; 
Korhonen, 2019: "the  analyses  show  statistically  significant  changes  in  both  ice  cover  and  discharge  regime until the early 21st century". 
Nowadays, the stationary assumption is doubted due to trends detected in time series observed meteorological variables (Vihma et al., 2016) as well as in river water discharges [Rosmann et al., 2016; Milly et al., 2005; 2008].
Shevnina et al., 2019; Shevnina, 2011

Why hydropower production is important?
Most of hydropower plants have no artificial reservoirs to redistribute water year-by-year, and they operate as run-of-river facility forced by naturally flowing river water  through canals or penstocks to spin a turbine [47]. The hydropower production on run-of-river plants depends strongly on a river water discharge, since there are no tools to regulate water stream flow.

How the risks of hydropower are estimated?


Since late 1990s, the statistically significant trends are detected in many time series of yearly average, maximal and minimal river discharges (XXX; XXX; XXX). ... These trends are connected either human activities (water regulation; change of a land cover) and/or natural fluctuations in weather and climate patterns, however they limit the application of the frequency analyses due to a stationarity hypothesis (XX;XX). In the stationary climate, the hydrological risks are evaluated from the observations. In changing climate, the risks are usually evaluated with hydrological models relayed on projections of meteorological parameters for the near future. 

How the exeedance probability curve is estimated?


What are limitations and gaps in the hydrological methods?

The lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models traditionally used for short term or seasonal scale simulating surface runoff times series from time series of meteorological variables [50]. In many catchment scale hydrological studies these models are driven by outputs of climate climate models or their ensemble to evaluate water resources and extremes of runoff in the near future on catchment scale [28, 49, 64]. However, the simulation of the surface runoff time series from the time series of meteorological variables (as in Veijalainen et al. 201XX) leads to high computational costs while estimating the hydrological extremes needed in economic application [65]. 

 the AFA method (Kovalenko, 2009; Kovalenko, 2004; Pugachev, 1978). 
It is implemented in the probabilistic hydrological model, whch is computationally cheap while to compare to lumped or semi-distributed physically-based hydrological models (Shevnina and Silaev, 2018). Shevnina et al., (2017)
Role of spatial resolution: We used two climate models of different spatial resolutions to test the probabilistic MARCS model simulated the parameters of exceedance probability curves on a catchment scale. We found that an increase of the spatial resolution does not affect to the results of simulations. 
 
What and why needed to focus on the probabilistic approach?

## data by 15.01.2021
the study is based both on observational data amd model simulations....

# hydrological observations
In our study we used the river discharges... 
1) the collection of the data by Gudmunson et al., (2018). The authors analyse the quality of the observed time series of the river discharches collected in the various datasets by using a set of uniformed methods to evaluate the quality of the hydrological records in them. 

Gudmunson et al. 2018: "Until now, most relevant in situ observations have been held by national and regional authorities, and despite their best efforts, international data centres only have access to a small subset of the full observed record (Do et al., 2018a). This situation stands in contrast to the fact that monitoring data are increasingly being made publicly available through regional and national authorities (Do et al., 2018a). In this paper series, we present an international collection of river and streamflow observations that covers more than 30 000 stations around the globe, highlighting the fact that these are among the best monitored variables of the terrestrial water cycle (Fekete et al., 2012, 2015; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2015; Hannah et al., 2011). "

2) the data collected in gauges located on rivers not disturbed by human activity such us runoff regulation nor land cover changes ( https://www.bafg.de/GRDC/EN/04_spcldtbss/46_CSS/css_node.html). The gauges are mostly located in France and nearby regions, UK, Iceland, Sweden and Finland. 

3) the RArctic collection (https://www.bafg.de/GRDC/EN/04_spcldtbss/41_ARDB/ardb_node.html): to include river catchments located in the Russian Federation.


Further, the gauges oultined the catchment area less then 1000 km2 were excluded to skip off local scale features in the hydrological regime. Many studies reccoment also exclude the gauges outlined the catchments with the area more 50000 km2 to being not accounted for the global scale features in the hydrological regime of the rivers considered (Shevnina et. al., 2017; Rozhdestvenskiy, 1986). In our study, we also included those gauges since the area of 50 000 km2 (or 200 km x 250 km) which is much smaller than a typical radius of a synoptic-scale cyclone (XXX; XX). 

I have selected 35 gauges located at the European rivers with (a) catchement area more than 1000 km2; (b) do not disturbed by water regulation; (c) with the longest observational time series of a good quality; (d) located in various climate (vegetation) zones.  Figure at the attachement shows the location of the gauges colored according to the sources offered the metadata: the GRDC climate stations (red dots); the dataset collection by Gunmunsson et al., 2018 (blue dots) and the RArctic dataset (orange dots) were used used. In each dataset, the metadata includes the river name, station name, altitude, catchemnt area, date of start/end of series, the length, overview on the quality control and national indentification. Fig. XX Hydrological network

The hydrological sites mostly located in two climate zones (C and D according to Beck et al., 2018). The list of the stations includes 13 gauges located in Russia, 3 gauges in Norway, 2 gauges in Finalnd, Sweden, Estonia, Germany, France, GB, and 1 gauges in NL, Iceland, Belorus, Czech, Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania. There no any time series longer then 39 years were found in Italy, Spain, Portugal ang Greek.

Table 1 shows the gauges, catchment areas and lengths of the time series, which was used in analyse of the river surface runoff. In GRDC datasets, the observations on the river surface runoff is expressed in a volumetric flow rate (water discharge, m3s-1). In our study, the volumetric rate was converted to a specific water discharge, and the yearly time series of annual specific discharge (noted further as ARR, mm yr-1 ) were calculated as follows:
ARR = 1000 Q T / A,				 (1)
where Q is a yearly average water discharge, m3s-1; T is a number of seconds in a year, and A is a catchment area, m2. This formula was applied while calculating the water discharge from the annual specific discharge for the projected period.

# meteorological reanalyses 

What are the reanalyses:
a) ERA5 or ERA5 Land
b) the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA's official name, just to remind that they discourage to use the acronym CARRA).

TV by 7.01.2021: "Tuomas wrote that he has already downloaded ERA5 data on Z200, Z500, precipitation and evaporation. I guess from 1979 to almost present."

by TV by 12.01.2021: "I thin atmospheric circulation is reasonably well presented in reanalyses also before 1979, but there may be larger errors in moisture variables. In Jakobson and Vihma (2010, DOI: 10.1002/joc.2039) we excluded the years before 1979, because trends in evaporation, precipitation and net precipitation showed remarkable changes around 1979 (see Figure 2 and Table 1 in the paper). We were not sure how large portions of these changes can be explained by the assimilation of satellite data (e.g. AMSU-B) and by (true) decadal changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation, and we therefore adopted a careful approach and included in the analyses data from 1979 only."

AK by 11.01.2021: "The reanalysis before 1979 may be not as good as that after 1979 but it does not necessarily mean that these data is not useful. I’ve never studied how the quality of reanalyses drops before 1979, perhaps there are studies that are relevant for us? But I would expect that at least large-scale circulation should be reasonably well constrained in the Northern hemisphere also before 1979. Of course the amount of reanalysis data that would need to be downloaded can be large, which is another issue." 

How the reanalyses reproduce the observations at the nearest SYNOP stations?
