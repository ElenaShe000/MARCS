# General Description
This setup of the model includes the code on Python and CDO driving by BASH scripts. There are four blocks of the code: 

model_core.py includes the model core version 0.3 (Shevnina and Silaev, 2018: https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2018-108);
model_setup.py includes calculation of the annual specific discharges (mm yr-1) from the datafiles of GRDC;



Results:
pvm_GRDC.zip includes the yearly time series extracted from the GRDC dataset;
reference_climate.zip includes the yearly values from the monthly values using the data by NOAA: precip.mon.total.v401.nc;
